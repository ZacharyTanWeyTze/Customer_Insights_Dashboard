Mock data for a ficticious company called Stargazers Coffee.

AI Prompts
- Can you tell me what a customer insights dashboard is and show me what one might look like? Don't use any data, just a very simple mock-up.
- I've uploaded a csv file called shop_transactions.csv to the Project Knowledge which contains customer transactions for a coffee shop called Stargazers Coffee. What insights can you tell me about the data? I don't want a deep analysis nor any visualizations - just a brief text summary of the fields of data and key metrics. (the reason I'm being very specific here about not conducting a deep analysis or preparing visualizations is Claude really does get excited when you prompt it and it wants to create artifacts. Let's put some boundaries, if you like, around the scope of our request and execute the chat and see how we go.)
- Can you create an interactive Data Explorer using the csv file provided in the project knowledge? I'd like to be able to filter, sort, and search through my transaction data with custom parameters.
- Can you build an interactive dashboard for Stargazers Coffee using the csv file provided? The areas of interest that I'd like to focus on are: product breakdown, weather impact, and location comparison.
- Firstly, I'm curious about daily performance. Which days are busier than others? Using the data provided in the CSV file. Can you please prepare a Heatmap Calendar for Stargazers coffee as a new artifact? I'm looking for a visual calendar showing daily performance where the color intensity represents sales volume. 
- Love your work. Can you now prepare a predictive sales model for Stargazers Coffee as a new artifact? I'm looking for a forecast tool that uses historical patterns to predict future sales.
